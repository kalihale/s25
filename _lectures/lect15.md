# Topics
* Divide and Conquer Algorithms
 - Subdivide a larger problem into smaller problems
 - Solve each smaller part
 - Combine solutions of smaller sub problems back into the larger problem

* Sorting: So far we covered selection sort which runs in O(n^2) 
* Today we will learn about Merge Sort, which runs in O(n log n)
