# Topics
* Graphs: terminology and applications
* Size of graphs, dense vs. sparse graphs
* Representation: adjacency matrix vs. adjacency list (space complexity)
* Connections to implementing a neural network (topic for lab07)
* Lab07 starter code for in class activity: <https://github.com/ucsb-cs24-w24/STARTER-lab07>
